  /** Creates a discount code creation job.
   The batch endpoint can be used to asynchronously create up to 100 discount codes in a single request. It
   enqueues and returns a discount_code_creation object that can be monitored for completion.
   You can enqueue a single creation job per a shop and you can't enqueue more until the job completes.
   Response fields that are specific to the batch endpoint include:
   status: The state of the discount code creation job. Possible values are:
   queued: The job is acknowledged, but not started.
   running: The job is in process.
   completed: The job has finished.
   codes_count: The number of discount codes to create.
   imported_count: The number of discount codes created successfully.
   failed_count: The number of discount codes that were not created successfully. Unsuccessful attempts will retry up to three times.
   logs: A report that specifies when no discount codes were created because the provided data was invalid. Example responses:
   "Price rule target selection can't be blank"
   "Price rule allocation method can't be blank"

export type DraftOrderId = number;

export namespace DraftOrder {
  /** Creates a draft order.
   Using the DraftOrder resource you can create orders in draft state using product variant line items,
   or custom line items. To create a product variant draft order, provide the variant_id, quantity and discount properties. To create a custom line item, provide the title, price, taxable,
   and quantity properties.
   Note
   If you are using this endpoint with a Partner development store or a trial store, then you can only create five draft orders per minute.
   Polling
   When you create and update draft orders some calculations are done asynchronously, such as calculating shipping and taxes. There might be times when a draft order is created but these calculations haven't completed. In these cases, you need to poll the draft order until the calculations are finished.
   When a draft order requires polling, a 202 accepted response code is returned along with location and retry-after response headers. The location header refers to the URL to be polled, and retry-after denotes the interval (in seconds) at which polling requests should be sent. When the draft order is ready, a 200 OK response code will be returned.
   About custom shipping lines
   You can use the DraftOrder resource to send orders with custom shipping lines.
   A custom shipping line includes a title and price with handle
   set to Nil. A shipping line with a carrier provided shipping rate
   (currently set via the Shopify admin) includes the shipping rate handle.
   Applying discounts
   A draft order and its line items can have one discount each. Calculations for discounts are based on the setting
   of the value_type property, which can be set to either fixed_amount or percentage.
   For example, you can apply a fixed amount discount to a draft order to reduce the price by the specified value property.
   When you use a percentage discount, the discount amount property is the price multiplied by the value property.
   For line item discounts, the value property is applied per individual unit of the item, based on the line item's quantity.
   Calculating line item discount amounts
   For fixed_amount discounts, the total amount corresponds to the line item quantity
   times the value of the discount.
   For percentage discounts, the total amount corresponds to the following:
   amount = floor(price * quantity * value) / 100, where floor() is the usual round down function.
   For non-fractional currencies, this formula needs to use round() instead of floor(), and the division by 100 takes place inside the rounding, resulting in a non-fractional value.
   Otherwise, an error is returned.
   amount = round(price * quantity * value / 100)
   Line item examples
   Fixed amount discount
   For a $19.99 line item with quantity of 2 and with $5 dollars off,
   discount amount corresponds to $10 ($5 * 2):
   applied_discount: { "value_type": "fixed_amount", "value": 5, "amount": 10 }
   For a fixed amount example, see Create a draft order with a discount.
   Percentage discount
   For a $19.99 line item with quantity of 2 and with 15% off,
   discount amount corresponds to $5.99 (floor ($19.99 * 2 * 15) / 100):
   applied_discount: { "value_type": "percentage", "value": 15, "amount": 5.99 }
   For a percentage example, see Create a percent discount on a line item.
   Loading and removing customers
   You can load a customer to a draft order by sending the customer_id as part of the draft order object. The recommended way to remove a customer from a draft order is to make a POST request with the Customer object set to null,
   without specifying an email, shipping address, or billing address.
   A customer may also be removed by setting customer, email, shipping_address, and billing_address to null.

   bypass: Do not claim inventory.
   decrement_ignoring_policy: Ignore the product's inventory policy and claim inventory.
   decrement_obeying_policy: Follow the product's inventory policy and claim inventory, if possible.
   send_receipt: Whether to send an order confirmation to the customer. (default: `false`)
   Note
   If you're working on a private app and order confirmations are still being sent to the customer when send_receipt is set to false, then you need to disable the Storefront API from the private app's page in the Shopify admin.

   If you are including shipping_address or billing_address, make sure to pass both

   If the line items use an external fulfillment service, then they will be queued for fulfillment and the status will be set to pending until the external fulfillment service has been invoked.
   A fulfillment might then transition to open, which implies it is being processed by the service, before transitioning to success when the items have shipped.
   If you don't specify line item IDs, then all unfulfilled and partially fulfilled line items for the order will be fulfilled.
   However, if an order is refunded or if any of its individual line items are refunded, then the order can't be fulfilled.
   All line items being fulfilled must have the same fulfillment service.
   Note
   If you are using this endpoint with a Partner development store or a trial store, then you can create no more than 5 new fulfillments per minute.
   About tracking urls
   If you're creating a fulfillment for a supported carrier, then you can send the tracking_company and tracking_numbers fields, and Shopify will generate the tracking_url for you. If you're creating a fulfillment for an unsupported carrier (not in the tracking_company list), then send the tracking_company, tracking_numbers, and tracking_urls fields.
   Note
   If you send an unsupported carrier without a tracking URL, then Shopify will still try to generate a valid tracking URL by using pattern matching on the tracking number. However, Shopify does not validate the tracking URL, so you should make sure that your tracking URL is correct for the order and fulfillment.
